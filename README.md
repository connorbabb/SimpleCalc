# Overview

I wanted to expand my knowledge on the Kotlin language by having it read through a user inputted string and have it output something. I wanted to use Kotlin since it is widely used by a lot of different companies for a variety of things. I/O is one of the best skills to learn in any programming language.

The program asks the user for a string input and then analyzes and computes the result from the equation given. It catches an error if there is a spacing or invalid amount of operators. It displays the result to the screen for the user.

# Development Environment

I only used the Kotlin language with modules for reading input and math. I used several websites and official Kotlin documentation as well as AI for testing and problem solving.
